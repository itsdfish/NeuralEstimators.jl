# NeuralEstimators documentation

Landing page and brief description of neural estimators as a recent likelihood-inference approach, and an alternative to ABC.

For those new to Julia, you may also be interested in the Julia packages [Flux](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/) (the deep learning framework this package is built upon), [Turing](https://turing.ml/stable/) (general-purpose probabilistic programming), and [Mill](https://ctuavastlab.github.io/Mill.jl/stable/) (caters for general multi-instance learning models, i.e., Deep Sets).
