#---- TODO
# - Testing on Windows
# - Landing page: add links to related software (e.g., BayesFlow)
# - Documentation: sometimes use 'd' to denote the dimension of the response variable, and sometimes 'q'... try to be consistent
# - assess(est::EM) 
# - assess(est::QuantileEstimator), assess(est::RatioEstimator), assess(est::GibbsSampler) using simulation-based calibration (e.g., qq plots)
# - Examples: Bivariate data in multivariate section
# - Helper functions for censored data, and provide an example in the documentation (maybe tied in with the bivariate data example).
 
# ---- once the software is reasonably polished:
# - Add NeuralEstimators.jl to the list of packages that use Documenter: see https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/examples/
# -	Add NeuralEstimators.jl to https://github.com/smsharma/awesome-neural-sbi#code-packages-and-benchmarks.
# -	Once NeuralEstimators is on the Julia package manager, add the following to index.md:
#
# Install `NeuralEstimators` from [Julia](https://julialang.org/)'s package manager using the following command inside Julia:
#
# ```
# using Pkg; Pkg.add("NeuralEstimators")
# ```

# ---- long term:
# - Examples: discrete parameters (e.g., Chan et al., 2018). Might need extra functionality for this. 
# - See if DeepSet can be moved to Flux.jl
# - Precompile NeuralEstimators.jl to reduce latency: See https://julialang.org/blog/2021/01/precompile_tutorial/. Seems easy, just need to add precompile(f, (arg_typesâ€¦)) to whichever methods we want to precompile
# - Examples: data plots within each example. Can show a histogram for univariate data; a scatterplot for bivariate data; a heatmap for gridded data; and scatterplot for irregular spatial data.
# - Extension: Incorporate the following package to greatly expand bootstrap functionality: https://github.com/juliangehring/Bootstrap.jl. Note also the "straps()" method that allows one to obtain the bootstrap distribution. I think what I can do is define a method of interval(bs::BootstrapSample). Maybe one difficulty will be how to re-sample... Not sure how the bootstrap method will know to sample from the independent replicates dimension (the last dimension) of each array.
# - GPU on MacOS with Metal.jl (already have extension written, need to wait until Metal.jl is further developed; in particular, need convolution layers to be implemented)
# - Explicit learning of summary statistics
# - Amortised posterior approximation (https://github.com/slimgroup/InvertibleNetworks.jl)
# - Functionality for storing and plotting the training-validation risk in the NeuralEstimator. This will involve changing _train() to return both the estimator and the risk, and then defining train(::NeuralEstimator) to update the slot containing the risk. We will also need _train() to take the argument "loss_vs_epoch", so that we can "continue training"
# - Separate GNN functionality (tried this with package extensions but not possible currently because we need to define custom structs)
# - SpatialPyramidPool for CNNs 
# - Optionally store parameter_names in NeuralEstimator: they can be used in bootstrap() so that the bootstrap estimates and resulting intervals are given informative names
# - Turn some document examples into "doctests"
# - Add "AR(k) time series" example, or a Ricker model (an example using partially exchangeable neural networks)
