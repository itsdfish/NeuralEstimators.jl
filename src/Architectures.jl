	samplesize(Z)

Computes the sample size m for a set of independent realisations `Z`, often

"""
    DeepSet(ψ, ϕ, a)
	DeepSet(ψ, ϕ; a::String = "mean")

The Deep Set representation,

```math
θ̂(𝐙) = ϕ(𝐓(𝐙)),	 	 𝐓(𝐙) = 𝐚(\\{ψ(𝐙ᵢ) : i = 1, …, m\\}),
```

where 𝐙 ≡ (𝐙₁', …, 𝐙ₘ')' are independent replicates from the model, `ψ` and `ϕ`
are neural networks, and `a` is a permutation-invariant aggregation function.

To make the architecture agnostic to the sample size ``m``, the aggregation
function `a` must aggregate over the replicates. It can be specified as a
positional argument of type `Function`, or as a keyword argument with
permissible values `"mean"`, `"sum"`, and `"logsumexp"`.

`DeepSet` objects act on data stored as `Vector{A}`, where each
element of the vector is associated with one parameter vector (i.e., one set of
independent replicates), and where `A` depends on the form of the data and the
chosen architecture for `ψ`. As a rule of thumb, when the data are stored as an
array, the replicates are stored in the final dimension of the array. (This is
usually the 'batch' dimension, but batching with `DeepSets` is done at the set
level, i.e., sets of replicates are batched together.) For example, with
gridded spatial data and `ψ` a CNN, `A` should be
a 4-dimensional array, with the replicates stored in the 4ᵗʰ dimension.

Note that, internally, data stored as `Vector{Arrays}` are first
concatenated along the replicates dimension before being passed into the inner
neural network `ψ`; this means that `ψ` is applied to a single large array
rather than many small arrays, which can substantially improve computational
efficiency, particularly on the GPU.

Set-level information, ``𝐱``, that is not a function of the data can be passed
directly into the outer network `ϕ` in the following manner,

```math
θ̂(𝐙) = ϕ((𝐓(𝐙)', 𝐱')'),	 	 𝐓(𝐙) = 𝐚(\\{ψ(𝐙ᵢ) : i = 1, …, m\\}),
```

This is done by providing a `Tuple{Vector{A}, Vector{B}}`, where
the first element of the tuple contains the vector of data sets and the second
element contains the vector of set-level information.

# ---- GraphPropagatePool ----

"""
    GraphPropagatePool(propagation, globalpool)

A graph neural network (GNN) module designed to act as the inner network `ψ` in
the `DeepSet`/`DeepSetExpert` architecture.

The `propagation` module transforms graphical input
data into a set of hidden feature graphs; the `globalpool` module aggregates
the feature graphs (graph-wise) into a single hidden-feature vector.
Critically, this hidden-feature vector is of fixed length irrespective of the
size and shape of the graph.

The data should be a `GNNGraph` or `AbstractVector{GNNGraph}`, where each graph
is associated with a single parameter vector. The graphs may contain sub-graphs
corresponding to independent replicates from the model.

Converts a vector `v` of length ``d(d+1)÷2`` into a ``d``-dimensional lower
or upper triangular matrix.

Note that the triangular matrix is constructed on the CPU, but the returned
matrix will be a GPU array if `v` is a GPU array. Note also that the
return type is not of type `Triangular` matrix (i.e., the zeros are
materialised) since `Traingular` matrices are not always compatible with other
GPU operations.

    CholeskyParameters(d)
	CholeskyParametersConstrained(d, determinant = 1f0)
Layer for constructing the parameters of a Cholesky factor for a `d`-dimensional
random vector.

This layer transforms an `Matrix` with `d`(`d`+1)÷2 rows (the number of
non-zero elements in a Cholesky factor) into a `Matrix` of the same
dimension, but with `d` rows constrained to be positive (corresponding to
the diagonal elements of the Cholesky factor) and the remaining rows
unconstrained.

The ordering of the transformed array aligns with Julia's column-major ordering,
so that a Cholesky factor with `d` = 3,

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
L₁₁ &  &  \\
L₂₁ & L₂₂ &  \\
L₃₁ & L₃₂ & L₃₃ \\
\end{bmatrix},
```

will follow the ordering ``[L₁₁, L₂₁, L₃₁, L₂₂, L₃₂, L₃₃]'``. Since
the diagonal elements must be positive, in this example rows 1, 4, and 6 of the
transformed array will be constrained to be positive.

`CholeskyParametersConstrained` constrains the `determinant` of the Cholesky
factor. Since the determinant of a triangular matrix is equal to the product of
its diagonal elements, the determinant is constrained by setting the final
diagonal element equal to `determinant`/``(Π Lᵢᵢ)`` where the product is over
``i < d``.

    CovarianceMatrixParameters(d)
	CovarianceMatrixParametersConstrained(d, determinant = 1f0)

Layer for constructing the parameters of a covariance matrix for a
`d`-dimensional random vector.

Due to symmetry, there are `d`(`d` + 1)/2 free parameters in a covariance
matrix, so this layer transforms a `Matrix` with `d`(`d` + 1)/2 rows into a
`Matrix` of the same dimension. Internally, it uses a `CholeskyParameters` layer
to construct a valid Cholesky factor, from which a positive-definite covariance
matrix Σ can be computed.

The ordering of the transformed array aligns with Julia's column-major ordering,
so that a covariance matrix with `d` = 3,

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
Σ₁₁ & Σ₁₂ & Σ₁₃ \\
Σ₂₁ & Σ₂₂ & Σ₂₃ \\
Σ₃₁ & Σ₃₂ & Σ₃₃ \\
\end{bmatrix},
```

will follow the ordering ``[Σ₁₁, Σ₂₁, Σ₃₁, Σ₂₂, Σ₃₂, Σ₃₃]'``. Only
the lower triangle of the matrix is returned because covariance matrices are
symmetric.

`CovarianceMatrixParametersConstrained` constrains the `determinant` of the
covariance matrix to `determinant`.

# (note that Symmetric behaves slightly differently on GPU and CPU matrices, so
# for consistency we first move the lower triangular matrix to the CPU)

"""
	SplitApply(layers, indices)
Splits an array into multiple sub-arrays by subsetting the rows using
the collection of `indices`, and then applies each layer in `layers` to the

Specifically, for each `i` = 1, …, ``n``, with ``n`` the number of `layers`,
`SplitApply(x)` performs `layers[i](x[indices[i], :])`, and then vertically
concatenates the resulting transformed arrays.
